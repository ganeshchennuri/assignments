Backend Coding Task
Context
AWS maintains documentation about each of its services — the actions those services support, the resources and conditions that are applicable for those actions etc. At Symmetry, we use this information to validate and check if a particular policy is well formed etc.
However, this information is not provided by the AWS in any structured manner other than the basic HTML pages and tables in the documentation liked above.


Problem Statement
Your task is to write a Python script that can crawl all the service pages in the documentation (links to each service are listed at root of documentation) and extract the data from those pages to produce json files for each service. A sample JSON produced for airflow service is shown in the appendix at the end of this document.
The elements to be parsed from the page are:
1. prefix — AWS service prefix. (In the Fig. 2 below, it is “airflow” mentioned in the first line of the service documentation.)
2. link — link of the documentation page
3. actions — an array of actions supported by this service. This data comes from the actions table as seen in the first table in Fig. 3 below. Each row in the action becomes one struct entry of this array. See the sample json at the end.
4. resources — an array of resources supported by this service. This data comes from the resources table as seen in the second table in Fig. 3 below. See the sample json at the end.
5. conditions — an array of conditions supported by this service. This data comes from the conditions table as in the third table in Fig. 3 below. See the sample json at the end.
Please feel free to ask any question in case of a doubt.
Please see the Appendix on the next page.
